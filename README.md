# Reservation Radar: Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction Using ML

> A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting and Reducing Hotel Booking Cancellations  

## Project Overview  

This project presents an end-to-end data science solution designed to help the hospitality industry tackle one of its critical challenges ‚Äî booking cancellations.

Using real-world hotel booking data from the pre-COVID era (2017-2019), this project aims to uncover the key factors contributing to cancellations and build predictive models to identify at-risk bookings.

Hotels can leverage this analysis to improve operational efficiency, optimize pricing, enhance customer loyalty, and minimize lost revenue due to cancellations.

## Problem Statement  

Hotel booking cancellations cause significant disruptions in the hospitality sector, affecting:  
- Revenue generation  
- Capacity planning  
- Inventory & Resource allocation  
- Customer experience  

The primary objective of this project is to use Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a booking will be canceled based on customer and booking attributes.

## Dataset Description  

The dataset contains detailed records of hotel bookings with the following key features:

- Number of adults and children per booking üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶  
- Lead time between booking and arrival ‚è≥  
- Room type reserved üè†  
- Average price per room üíµ  
- Special requests (e.g., extra bed, late check-in)  
- Guest type (First-time or Repeated Guest) üîÑ  
- Parking space requirement üöó  
- Market segment (Online, Offline, Corporate, etc.)  
- Booking status (Canceled or Not Canceled) üéØ  

## Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing  
- Removal of invalid records (e.g., impossible dates, zero prices)  
- Handling of missing values  
- Outlier treatment using appropriate transformations (Sqrt & Log)  
- Date feature extraction (Month, Week, Day of Year)  
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

Comprehensive analysis was conducted to identify trends and patterns within the dataset.

#### Key Insights:  

| Observation | Business Recommendation |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Bulk bookings (large groups) have higher cancellation rates | Design flexible policies and offers for group bookings |
| Higher room prices correlate with cancellations | Implement loyalty discounts & early booking offers |
| First-time guests cancel more often than repeat guests | Launch customer loyalty and rewards programs |
| Reserved parking guests have lower cancellation rates | Provide incentives to non-parking guests |
| Fewer cancellations observed in Quarter 4 | Promote early booking campaigns during other quarters |

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering  

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was applied to select the most influential features for prediction:

- Lead Time  
- Average Price per Room  
- Parking Space Requirement  
- Repeated Guest Status  
- Special Requests  
- Room Type Reserved  
- Market Segment Type  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Models  

Multiple models were built and evaluated to classify bookings as Canceled or Not Canceled.

| Model | Accuracy | AUC Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | 74% | 0.72 |
| Random Forest | 89% | 0.92 |
| XGBoost | 84% | 0.90 |

#### The Random Forest Classifier outperformed other models in accuracy and robustness, making it the preferred choice for deployment.

## Tools & Technologies Used  

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization üìä  
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) 
- XGBoost for advanced boosting algorithms  

## Business Impact & Recommendations  

This project equips hotels with a data-driven approach to:  

- Proactively manage bookings and cancellations  
- Optimize pricing strategies and room allocation  
- Strengthen customer loyalty programs  
- Improve marketing campaigns based on seasonal trends  
- Minimize revenue loss due to last-minute cancellations  

## Final Note  

This project demonstrates the power of Data Science in the hospitality industry. By leveraging Machine Learning models, hotels can move from reactive to proactive cancellation management ‚Äî improving both profitability and guest satisfaction.
